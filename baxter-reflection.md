* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I had not really explored a merge conflict before the session. Additionally I was a little tripped up by the two uses of 'pull'. One for pulling files to local from github and the other when github merges a pull request.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

My pair and I worked though a merge conflict after our guide left and it was very satisfying and elegant in the way sublime offered a solution. Also, my pair showed me how sublime will seamlessly change which version of the file it is displaying based on which branch is being worked on. I was impressed by that.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked questions regarding how to work on a Mac, clarification on github pull requests, details of syncing local files to github, and managing conflicts.

* What still confuses you about Git?

I think I'm pretty comfortable with git on a conceptual level but need to get a lot more reps at going through the basic workflow to feel proficient. I think that I know how to look up what I need to do at certain points and at least I know what I would be looking for. I've been reading a lot on my own which has been helpful but it really has shown me that I only know a small amount when compared to other users so I'm a bit worried that I don't know what I don't know. I've been focusing on getting a better understanding of pull, fetch, and merge.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first experience went great. Zaki, my pair, set the bar really high for future pairings. I felt like his knowledge filled in any holes in concepts that I was uncertain about. He also had an excellent demeanor and was thoughtful in giving feedback. I was really impressed and am looking forward to working together in person on-site.

Neal was our guide and helped us along the way. He didn't mind staying in the background unless we needed his assistance, which is a style that I think is just fine. He was knowledgeable on the content and was able to explain things clearly.
