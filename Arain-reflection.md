* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had a lot of trouble understanding the 'git push' and 'git pull' commands, and understanding the local and remote roles. Also, knowing when to commit has been difficult for me. I'm tempted to always want to commit whenever I have made a change, but I can see how that is cumbersome.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Using the GitHub repo has become slightly more familiar to me, and I am become more comfortable with pushing and pulling. I accidentally pushed my master to the remote master repo, but I'm glad I made that mistake in this environment and not a higher-stakes environment.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about when to use push and pull, and when to use the commit. They were both very helpful in clarifying my thoughts.

* What still confuses you about Git?
I'm still confused about how I can fit my git workflow in with a pair that I am working with. If we are both working on the same repo, it gets confusing when I should push my branch to the remote repo, and when I should pull the remote master.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was excellent! I'm looking forward to more sessions like it!
